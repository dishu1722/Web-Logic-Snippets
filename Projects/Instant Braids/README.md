# 💇‍♀️ Instant Braids - E-commerce UI/UX Redesign

A high-fidelity redesign of an Australian beauty brand specializing in braided hair extensions. This project focused on elevating the brand's digital presence by implementing a modern, "premium-feel" interface inspired by industry-leading beauty retailers.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Features

### **1. Homepage Architecture & Visual Hierarchy**
* **Modern Layout Redesign:** Reconstructed the homepage from the ground up to improve visual flow. I implemented a clean, high-contrast aesthetic using a monochromatic palette to make the product photography stand out.
* **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** Prioritized the mobile shopping experience by engineering fluid layouts and touch-friendly navigation components.
* **Conversion-Driven UI:** Integrated strategic "Shop Now" call-to-actions (CTAs) and trust-building sections (FAQ accordions and shipping highlights) to reduce bounce rates.

### **2. WooCommerce Product Page Engineering**
* **Variation Selection Logic:** Enhanced the Single Product Page to include intuitive selectors for size and color. I resolved previous issues with missing variation options, ensuring a 100% functional shopping loop.
* **Custom Template Styling:** Overrode default WooCommerce styling to create a streamlined, minimalist product view. This included custom CSS for the price display, "Add to Cart" components, and payment gateway icons.
* **Feature Highlights:** Integrated custom icon sets to display product benefits (Texture, Heat Resistance, Shedding) directly on the product summary for quick customer education.

### **3. Brand Consistency & Footer Refinement**
* **Global Component Syncing:** Redesigned the site-wide footer to align with the new minimalist brand identity, ensuring consistent typography and social integration.
* **Asset Optimization:** Managed high-resolution product imagery to ensure the site maintained fast load times despite the heavy use of visual content.

## 💡 The "Beauty Standard" Solution
The primary challenge was moving away from a "generic" store look toward a high-end beauty aesthetic. By focusing on **whitespace, typography, and clear product variations**, I achieved:
* **Improved Navigation:** A simplified menu and footer structure.
* **Consistent Branding:** A unified look across the entire user journey.
* **Seamless Checkout Prep:** A product page that clearly communicates all variations (length, color) before the user reaches the cart.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools
* **Platform:** WordPress & WooCommerce
* **Design & Building:** Elementor, Custom CSS3, HTML5
* **Interactivity:** JavaScript / jQuery for variation selection and UI toggles
* **Methodology:** UI/UX Benchmarking, Responsive Design
