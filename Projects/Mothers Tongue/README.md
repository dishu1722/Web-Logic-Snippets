# 🌍 Mother's Tongue - Language Learning Landing Page

A vibrant, custom-built WordPress website designed for a children's language learning platform. This project involved high-fidelity UI replication of a reference site architecture while maintaining a unique brand identity through custom illustrations and a specific color palette.

## 🎨 Design & UX Strategy

### **1. High-Fidelity Design Execution**
* **Reference Translation:** Successfully mirrored the layout and flow of the industry-standard *pilipop.com*, creating a seamless transition from the mobile app experience to the web platform.
* **Brand Consistency:** Leveraged a primary palette of **Sky Blue (#23B0E7)** and **Bright Yellow (#FFC700)** to create a high-energy, kid-friendly environment.
* **Asset Integration:** Custom-styled app screenshots and character illustrations to guide the user's eye toward key product features and the "Our Method" sections.

### **2. Technical Implementation**
* **Pixel-Perfect Building:** Developed the Homepage and three internal pages (*Our Method, About, Our Offer*) using **Elementor** combined with **Custom CSS** for fine-tuned layout control.
* **Modular Components:** Created global header, navigation, and footer templates from scratch to ensure a unified user journey across all sub-pages.
* **Micro-Animations:** Implemented soft CSS animations and entrance transitions to give the site a "living" app feel, increasing engagement for parents and educators.

### **3. Mobile-First Optimization**
* **Tailored Mobile Interface:** Designed a specific mobile menu and collapsed footer layout to ensure the learning method remains readable and the "Try for Free" CTAs stay prominent on smaller screens.
* **Performance SEO:** Integrated **Yoast SEO** and optimized asset delivery to ensure fast loading times despite the rich, image-heavy design.

## 💡 The "Mother's Tongue" Solution
The challenge was to make a complex educational method feel simple and fun. I achieved this by:
* **Visual Storytelling:** Using a "Step-by-Step" layout to explain the listening and pronunciation technology.
* **Trust Building:** Incorporating a dedicated "Reviews" section and clear subscription comparison tables.
* **Clean Navigation:** Simplifying the user funnel to lead directly to the App Store and Google Play links.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools
* **Platform:** WordPress
* **Page Builder:** Elementor
* **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery
