# 👕 Less Cropped - Fashion E-commerce Optimization

A comprehensive WooCommerce customization for an Australian minimal fashion brand. This project focused on refining the user journey through advanced product filtering logic, layout reorganization, and mobile-first media optimization.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Features

### **1. Advanced Filter & Variation Logic (PHP/WooCommerce)**
* **Color Filter Synchronization:** Engineered a custom PHP fix to resolve a critical bug where color-based filtering displayed inaccurate product variations. I ensured that applying a filter dynamically updated the results to reflect the exact matching inventory.
* **ACF Integration:** Leveraged Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to manage and display specific fashion metadata, ensuring the backend remained user-friendly for the client.

### **2. Single Product Page Architecture (HTML5/CSS3)**
* **Conversion-Driven Layout:** Reorganized the single product template to place the Size Chart in close proximity to the variation selectors, reducing friction in the purchasing process.
* **Integrated Media Management:** Developed a custom layout priority system to ensure embedded product videos (Tolstoy stories) displayed correctly below the primary Swiper image gallery.
* **Sticky Information Sidebar:** Optimized the "stuck" information column for desktop users, ensuring product titles and "Add to Cart" actions remained visible during long scrolls.

### **3. UI/UX & Responsive Enhancements**
* **Mobile-First Product Templates:** Completely overhauled the mobile view for product templates, focusing on touch-friendly swiper navigation and optimized image loading.
* **Sidebar Widget Customization:** Balanced the product category pages by implementing a custom sidebar widget system, improving the visual weight and site-wide navigation.

## 💡 The "Fashion" Solution
For a minimal brand like **Less Cropped**, the interface needed to be as clean as the clothing. My role was to remove technical "clutter" by:
* **Fixing Logic Gaps:** Ensuring that what a user filters for is exactly what they see.
* **Improving Accessibility:** Making the size chart and product videos easier to find on small screens.
* **Visual Balance:** Adjusting the grid system to handle high-resolution fashion photography without slowing down the site.

* **Languages:** PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, HTML5
* **Platform:** WordPress & WooCommerce
* **Advanced Tools:** Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), Swiper.js (Gallery Logic), Elementor
