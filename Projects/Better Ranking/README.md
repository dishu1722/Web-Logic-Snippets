# 📈 Better Ranking - Conversion-Focused Web Design

A modern, high-performance website build focused on organic growth and user engagement. This project involved designing the core site architecture—including the Home, About, and Blog pages—using the Blocksy Builder to ensure a lightweight, SEO-optimized foundation.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Features

### **1. Visual Design & User Experience (UX)**
* **Custom Layout Architecture:** Designed a professional, clean UI focused on brand authority. I built the Home and About pages with a "content-first" approach to ensure clear value propositions.
* **Responsive Styling:** Leveraged Blocksy’s flexible grid system to create a pixel-perfect experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Component Reusability:** Built modular block patterns for the blog and service sections, ensuring design consistency and easy content updates for the client.

### **2. Performance & SEO Optimization**
* **Lightweight Build:** Prioritized native Gutenberg blocks and Blocksy's clean code output to maintain fast load times and high Core Web Vitals scores.
* **Blog Strategy:** Designed a high-readability blog layout with optimized heading hierarchies (H1-H4) to assist search engine crawlers and improve the user's reading experience.
* **Dynamic Content Loading:** Configured blog archives to handle image optimization and lazy-loading, reducing initial page weight.

### **3. Strategic Marketing Integration**
* **Call-to-Action (CTA) Placement:** Strategically placed lead-capture elements throughout the site to maximize conversion rates.
* **Identity Branding:** Translated the brand’s professional vision into a digital interface, focusing on typography, whitespace, and visual hierarchy.
