# 💻 West Point Digital - Enterprise IT & E-commerce Solutions

A modern, scalable corporate website built for a technology-driven IT service provider. This project focused on creating a high-performance "Service-as-a-Product" architecture, allowing the client to manage complex service portfolios and multi-language case studies effortlessly.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **1. Scalable Content Architecture (ACF & CPT)**
* **Dynamic Data Modeling:** Utilized **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** to build structured data environments for "Services" and "Case Studies." This enables the client to update project details via simple backend fields without touching the design layout.
* **Custom Post Types:** Engineered bespoke CPTs to separate corporate content from marketing case studies, ensuring a clean and organized WordPress database structure.

### **2. Global Ready (WPML & Localization)**
* **Multi-language Framework:** Integrated and configured **WPML** to handle enterprise-level translation workflows, ensuring a seamless user experience across different regional markets.
* **Responsive Layouts:** Developed the full UI using **Elementor** combined with custom CSS to ensure pixel-perfect consistency on everything from 4K monitors to mobile devices.

### **3. Interactive UI Components**
* **Custom Service Carousels:** Leveraged **Owl Carousel** and jQuery to create interactive, touch-enabled sliders for showcasing client success stories.
* **Optimized Forms:** Implemented custom-styled **Contact Form 7** configurations tailored for high-intent B2B lead generation.

For a technology company, the website must act as a proof of competence. I achieved this by:
